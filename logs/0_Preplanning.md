# Preplanning
A converter from 2510 (stock E3V3SE fan) to 4010 (Noctua) requires proper screw sizes and lengths to make sure they fit.

## Key measurements
Measurement | Value
-|-
2510 Thickness | 10mm
2510 Screw Diameter | ~1.8mm* (we just need an adequate size that fits, since the heatsink already has threads)
2510 Screwhole Diameter | ~2.8mm (https://lab4450.com/product/delta-2510-5v-fan/)
2510 Screwhole Interval | 20mm
2510 Screw Length | 12mm*
Noctua Screwhole Diameter | 3.5mm (https://www.dekada.com/en/evercool-fan-40x40x10-el-bearing-4000-rpm-ec4010ll12ea-p-1094.html)
Noctua Screwhole Interval | 32mm
Top screwhole to extruder clearance | 3mm
Heatsink to front extruder length | 25mm*
Heatsink to extruder offset | 7mm* <-> 13mm*
